# Comfort Health Group Website

This is a responsive website for [Comfort Health Group](http://comforthealthgroup.org/), a leading provider of housing stabilization services in Minnesota focused on empowering individuals through stable housing solutions.

## Deployment

The site is statically generated and deployed to GitHub Pages. The build process involves:
